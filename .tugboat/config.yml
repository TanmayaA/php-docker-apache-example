    #   1. Clones the git repository into the service container

        # Link the document root to the expected path. Tugboat uses /docroot
        # by default. So, if the application is located at any other path in your git
        # repository, change that here. This example links /web to the docroot
        - ln -snf "${TUGBOAT_ROOT}/myapp" "${DOCROOT}"
